## Introduction

Video Generation Automation is a project that leverages advanced programs and algorithms to create videos from textual descriptions. It incorporates various technologies, including natural language processing, image processing, and audio synthesis. With this tool, you can quickly generate videos for educational, promotional, or informative purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`): `requests`, `audioread`, `PIL`, `transformers`, `gTTS`, `moviepy`, `icrawler`, and `whisper`.
- A Google Custom Search API Key and Custom Search Engine ID.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melbinjp/video-generation-automation.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Google Custom Search API Key and Custom Search Engine ID. Place these credentials in a `config.ini` file in the root directory of the project.

4. Run the script by executing:

```bash
python videogen.py
```

## Configuration

- Configure your settings in the `config.ini` file. This file includes parameters like the maximum filename length and file paths.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `videogen.py`. It will prompt you to enter a search query.
2. The script will search for interesting topics using Google Custom Search and retrieve the top result.
3. It will gather media by searching Google Images for related images.
4. Audio is generated based on the retrieved text.
5. A video is created using the images and audio.
6. Subtitles are added to the video.
7. The final video is saved in the `output` directory.

## How It Works

- The script uses Google Custom Search to find a relevant topic.
- It collects images from the web based on the search query.
- Text is generated using a language model from the `transformers` library.
- Audio is synthesized using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- The video is created by combining images and audio using `moviepy`.
- Subtitles are generated using the Whisper library and added to the video.
- The final video is saved in the `output` directory.
